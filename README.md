### Hello

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentRDC/LaurentRDC/master/images/header.svg"/>

I am the co-founder and CEO of [Powerweave](https://powerweave.io), a startup developing a platform to operate local electricity markets.

Previously, I worked in research at a proprietary trading firm, with a focus on algorithmic trading in electricity markets including physical real-time arbitrage and financial transmission rights (FTRs).

I also have a Ph.D. in ultrafast condensed matter physics from the [Physics Department at McGill University](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/). I worked on tracking ultrafast energy flow with ultrafast electron diffraction and diffuse scattering in strongly-correlated and functional materials with [Prof. Bradley Siwick](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/siwicklab/). The images above are ultrafast electron diffraction patterns from crystal systems I studied. You can read my publications [here](https://laurentrdc.xyz/publications.html).

In the course of my academic career, I have created and still maintain multiple software frameworks related to ultrafast electron diffraction ( [scikit-ued](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/scikit-ued), [iris-ued](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/iris-ued) ), crystallography ( [crystals](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/crystals) ), and out-of-memory array processing ( [npstreams](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/npstreams) ). Do not hesitate to contact me or raise a GitHub issue if I can help you use or extend these software packages.
