### Hello

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentRDC/LaurentRDC/master/images/symmetrized_vo2.svg">

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Physics Department at McGill University](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/), working on ultrafast energy flow in strongly-correlated materials with [Prof. Bradley Siwick](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/siwicklab/).
